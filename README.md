# gwsmpa_r\_quarto_viz_session

This repository is for our class session on Quarto and introduction to charting and mapping visualizations.

We'll practice cloning (and forking) this together during the session.

You can also cut to the chase by skipping the cloning if you're having trouble with your setup and downloading/opening the R project using this line of code in your console:

`usethis::use_course("https://github.com/amkessler/gwsmpa_r_quarto_viz_session/archive/refs/heads/main.zip")`
